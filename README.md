# IoT Hub Device Simulator

The IoT Hub Device Simulator is a small utility UWP app that allows you to quickly simulate IoT Devices to use with your Azure IoT Hub. 

Just paste a Connection String and define some sensor values that get sent to the IoT Hub.

You can either compile the app yourself or download it from the Windows Store.
